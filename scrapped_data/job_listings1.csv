Welcome to a unique opportunity that enables you to work from home and access a range of data entry research panelist positions. Our work from home data entry research panelist positions are ideal for individuals who are seeking part-time or full-time engagements or looking to diversify their career journey. Our remote positions are suitable for individuals from diverse professional backgrounds, including administrative assistants, data entry clerks, customer service representatives, or even drivers.

Regardless of your prior experience, we are here to connect you with companies that are ready to onboard you for remote work from the comfort of your own home. This exciting opportunity enables you to choose between full-time commitment and flexible part-time arrangements, all within a variety of fields that align with your interests.

We believe that genuine work-from-home data entry jobs are designed to leverage your skill set, and training will always be provided to complement the specific role you are applying for. You will find yourself earning between $30 to $45 per hour for single-session studies and up to an impressive $2,000 for multi-session studies, which is a testament to the rewards that come with this opportunity.

To embark on this journey, all you need is a computer with internet access and a tranquil workspace that shields you from distractions. Your ability to work independently and follow instructions without immediate supervision is key. While previous data entry or administrative experience is not mandatory, it could certainly be a bonus!

We welcome individuals from all backgrounds, including those with experience in healthcare, warehousing, deliveries, customer service, or any other realm. Your diversity enriches our team, and we are committed to providing a welcoming environment where you can grow and develop your skills.

You will need a laptop with a steady internet connection, and your webcam may come into play for certain studies (with extra rewards!). We are rooting for your data entry skills - reading, writing, following directions, and typing a minimum of 25 words per minute. If you have a background in customer service, administrative assistance, sales, or sales support, that's great, but it is not mandatory.

This opportunity enables you to participate in online or in-person discussions from the comfort of your own home, eliminating the need for tiresome commutes. You can set your own pace and choose whether you opt for part-time or full-time engagement. We look forward to welcoming you to our team and embarking on an exciting journey together.

North Knoxville Medical Center is an acute care hospital. The Powell hospital and medical center offers private patient rooms with dedicated family areas. In addition, the hospital has technologically advanced information and communications systems, decentralized nursing stations for better efficiency and patient care, and noise-reduction materials to provide patients with a more comfortable experience.

Nursing Care

North Knoxville Medical Center features workstations outside each patient room, which allows nurses to closely monitor every patient. Each floor has a business center for record management.
